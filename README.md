#### Flatmates data scraped and visualized using Python (BS4, Pandas, SeaBorn)

This is a personal project that I created for a friend to help him find accomodation in Sydney. The python script scrapes data from the Flatmates website and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame. The limit for scraped listings is set to 250 but can be increased to get all available results. However, it is advised to use the scraper late at night to not interfere with web traffic and user experience for other visitors.

#### Metrics Explored

1. Minimum rent with bills included
2. Minimum rent where share houses have 1 bathroom per 2 people
3. Share houses with a population between 1 and 3
4. Average Rent per property type
5. Properties available in the next 10 days
